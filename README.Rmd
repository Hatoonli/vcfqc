vcfqc is a tool that can visualize the distribution of quality annotation values in a table summary of VCF files. This visualization can help in setting threshhold values for hard-filtering.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of vcfqc by copying the following commands into R console:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("avramaral/GPcov", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is an example of quality by depth (QD) annotation distribution

```{r example}
library(vcfqc)
QD(system.file("extdata", "HG001_GRCh38.table", package = "vcfqc"))
```
